# Asteroids

Unity version: 2019.4.12f1

A simple clone of the Asteroids game - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)

Keyboard controls:
    WASD / Arrow keys - movement
    Space - shoot
    R - warp to random location

No leaderboard functionality or way to store your highscore at the end of the game.

Some potential code improvements have been left out due to the nature of the project and no specific benefits from implementing those.
